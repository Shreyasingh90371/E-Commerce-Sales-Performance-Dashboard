# E-Commerce-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore sales dataset to uncover key business insights and performance metrics. The primary goal was to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Tableau to provide a clear, at-a-glance view of the company's sales performance.

The dashboard tracks several key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

Total Revenue: Overall sales performance of the business.

Average Order Value (AOV): The average amount spent per order.

Key Analyses and Insights:

Top Product Performance: Identified the top 10 products by revenue, revealing a "hero product" (Canon imageCLASS 2200) that significantly outperforms others. This highlights both a key revenue driver and a potential risk if sales of this single product were to decline.

Monthly Revenue Trends: A time-series analysis shows strong seasonality in the business, with a significant sales peak in the fourth quarter (Q4). This insight is critical for inventory management, marketing campaigns, and resource planning.

Geographical Sales Distribution: A map visualisation clearly shows that sales are heavily concentrated on the East and West coasts of the United States, indicating underperformance or untapped market potential in the Central and Southern regions
